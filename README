This repository is to show the SelectMenus class that was added to loc.gov

It does not have any functionality on its own. It is strictly to display code.

select_menus.js contains the class SelectMenus

The other HTML and JS files show when and how the class is used

This class was used to refactor the code and greatly condense the amount of code originally in the other JS files.

You can see the code being used in practice by visiting

	The State/Province, County, City, and Newspaper menus are using the code
